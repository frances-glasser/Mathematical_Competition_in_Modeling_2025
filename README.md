# Mathmatical Competition in Modeling, Problem C (Data Science)

This challenge was to create a predictive multi-nominal model using athlete data, host countries for the olympics, medal counts for teams since the 1900s, and sports porgram infomation to predict the 2028 winners of the Olympic Games. 
We cleaned, transformed, and modeled the data so that we could predict the number of Gold, Silver, and Bronze medals for each country participating in the 2028 Olympic Games. Additionally, an academic report of no more than 25 pages was due within 4 
days of the competition's start. This repository contains my data cleaning and transformation efforts while Kenzo-Hoobert's repository (https://github.com/Kenzo-Hoobert/MCM-ICM-2025) is complete with this information, data analysis and visualizations,
and advanced modeling.
